"""Placement and parsing helpers for documents.

The Library is a real tree — a folder is a document with `kind='folder'`, so an
empty folder exists and a folder can carry an index body. That makes three
things this module owns: slugs that stay unique among siblings, a re-parent
guard so the tree cannot be knotted into a cycle, and the subtree walk that
`DELETE` needs because SQLite does not always enforce `ON DELETE CASCADE`
(`api/routes/designs.py` unwinds its own deletes for the same reason).

It also parses the YAML frontmatter out of a body. The body is the source of
truth — it is what exports to disk — and `documents.frontmatter` / `documents.tags`
are only a cache so a listing can filter without reading every body.
